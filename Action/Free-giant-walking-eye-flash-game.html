<h4>Game Description:</h4> Invade the Earth. Upgrade your walkers. Destroy humanity. This distance runner puts you in a an alien eyebot strider through 25 of the world's major cities. Use your lasers and missiles to fend off the human's pathetic attacks as your claw harvests their flesh for the good of the alien species. As you pick up speed, you'll gain a powerful shield, protecting you from tanks, bazookas, and helicopters.

</div>
						

<div id="instructions">
<div>
<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
-V key to fire the laser.

-C key to fire missiles & up/down arrow keys to aim (when unlocked).

-Space key to fire the Mothership Laser (when unlocked).

Choose a city to invade. You'll be tasked with a different goal in each--destroying tanks or helicopters, collecting humans, or reaching a distance. Kill off bazooka soldiers and tanks with your laser. Harvest the rest of the humans by letting them pass under your walker. Their flesh will serve as your money for upgrades. If you're hit while your speed is above 30 m/s, the shield will absorb the impact. Below 30, you'll die. The Mothership blast can help you survive Earth's most devastating attacks!

A 3D version of the Classic Brick-Breaker with new characters and a Tower Defense feel.

A square reservoir is infested by layers of Jellyfish which are killed and released by Goldfish. You control the Ice Block paddle to prevent the Goldfish and Jellyfish from escaping the reservoir. Goldfish evolve into very powerful Pufferfish and Vampirefish; Why Not?

Crabs at the bottom help redirect the memory challenged Goldfish towards the taunting Jellyfish hordes. The Crabs are easily exhausted and must eat at the coral food plots to regain their strength. You'll need them to finish three layers of Jellies to win the game quickly and survive endurance matches.

Play for FREE! Progress is saved locally as Guest or your Newgrounds userName. The GotCrabs~Skills act as a mixing board to customize your game from fast-n-furious to endurance-marathons. Read through the inGame Help Pages for details. OR, just sit back and enjoy the soothing Whale Song.</div>
