<h4>Game Description:</h4> Magic ball returns have three different modes. All modes have different types of environment, powers, bricks, pillars and miscellaneous animation. You will have a Magic ball to break those bricks and pillars. You would need to make sure that the ball never fall down otherwise you will lose a life. Some of bricks and pillars have good strength so you might need to throw ball twice to break them. There are many specials powers hidden behind the bricks or pillars which can be used to speed up the destruction of wall considerably. But beware! there could be some negative powers as well which could decrease your efficiency or take away your life. When you get a special power, it would take position at the left or right and you will tap onto the power to use it when required. No powers are carry forwarded to next level.
