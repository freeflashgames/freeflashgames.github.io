<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Your Mission

Guide Astro Charlie through various moon caverns, defeating many monsters on your way. Collect 8 Alchiems to complete your quest!!!

CONTROLS

Astro Charlie

i. Walking Around

Control Astro Charlie using the arrow keys.

ii. Jumping

Press the space key to make Astro Charlie jump. Press space while he is walking to the left to make him jump left, and likewise press space while he is moving to the right to make him jump to the right.

iii. Switch between Astro Charlie and Moon Mole

Press the up key to switch to controlling the Moon Mole (once it has been collected). The Moon Mole is only available underground. Move the Moon Mole back to Astro Charlie to switch back. Note that you can also switch back by pressing the space key, but this will consume some of your precious energy.

Deploy Gravity Stick

Once Gravity Sticks have been collected, they may be deployed by pressing the G key.

The Moon Mole

Find him on the Moon's surface, then once below the ground, select the Moon Mole (as mentioned above) and move around the screen using the up key. Use him to unlock the maze by chewing through certain walls. The Mole can only chew through certain walls - guide him to the base of each wall to try. The Moon Mole can also destroy most flying monsters.
		
GAME FEATURES

Alchiems

Collect these colored crystals to unlock the secret of the Monolith. Follow the in-game help clues for more information.

Red Astro

Red Astro will steal your Alchiems. Use Gravity Sticks to pin him to the ground and make your escape!	

Extra Lives

Find and collect Extra Life helmets hidden in the caves.

Gravity Sticks

Gravity Sticks are awarded when you gain an extra life - one per extra life. Use them to make monsters fall, activate by shaking the device. Gravity sticks are deployed at Astro Charlie's feet. Especially helpful for escaping Red Astro who will steal the precious alchiems from your grasp!

Wind Tunnel

Look for the wind tunnel. The winds can lift you up and cushion your fall, but ... be careful about which way you jump ...		

Teleports

These will teleport Astro Charlie to another room if he makes contact with them. Watch out for a hard landing!

ENHANCED MODE

The following features are only available in Enhanced Mode.

Moon Gloves

Before you can collect Alchiems you must liberate the Moon Gloves from the Giant Moon worms.

Map

Tap anywhere in the playable screen (other than Astro Charlie or the info and menu icons) to bring up the map. The map is color coded to help you find your way around. Your current room has a glowing box around it, and your current destination has a color cycle effect. Rooms that you have already visited are shown as a solid color. The map shows the possible locations of the Moon Mole, as well as the Alchiems, Additional Lives and so on.
