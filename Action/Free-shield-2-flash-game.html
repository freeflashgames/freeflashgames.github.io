 <p>Cure the Z...</p><div id="d">Some humans are turned into zombies after the outbreak of a dangerous virus in zone X. Now they are coming for the uninfected in other areas. As the heroic character in the game, your task is to collect the antidote so that the zombies can be reverted to humans. The game opens with an area which contains a number of obstacles, as well as 4 doors at the cardinal directions of north, south, east and west. Then a zombie will walk around and try to tag the humans. You can use the four arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movements of your character. To collect the antidote, you need to light up the 4 letters of C, U, R and E, but not necessarily in the exact order. The letters will appear one by one, and you need to control your character to run across all of the letters so that the antidote can be found. Be careful not to run across the letters which have already been lighted up or you will need to light it up again. When the antidote is available, move your character to collect it so that all zombies in the area can be cured and turned back to humans. At the start of each level, the zombies will first target the humans, but when all of the humans are tagged and mutated, they will all turn to hunt you. You will start the game with 3 lives, as indicated at the top left corner of the screen. When you are tagged by a zombie, one life will be deducted. A new hero will then arrive and you can continue the game, but when all lives are gone, the game ends. To escape from the zombies, you can make good use of the doors in order to come out from the other side, or collect the power-ups in the area. Each of the power-ups carries a unique effect and is labeled with different icons: the roller skate will increase the moving speed of your character; the clock will stun the zombies; the turtleback will slow down the zombies; the daze will disorient the zombies; and the icon of the hero will give you one extra life. The power-ups will appear randomly, so let them be your assistance before they vanish. Also bear in mind that except the extra life is granted permanently, all other power-ups only last for a few seconds, and the zombies will return to normal afterwards. Survive and save the humans until all areas are cleared!</div>
