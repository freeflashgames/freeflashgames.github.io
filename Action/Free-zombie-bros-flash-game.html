 <p>The Hare a...</p><div id="d">In the fairy tale, the diligent tortoise could beat the lazy rabbit and win the race. Can you revive the story and help the tortoise to lift the trophy once more? In this game, the tortoise will race against a hare to reach the destinations marked by flowers. As the targets will appear randomly, you need to move the mouse quickly so that the tortoise can be the first to reach the destinations. The hare will sleep when no flower is present, but whenever the target appears, it will make its move swiftly. If the tortoise beats the hare, a score will be given based on your reaction time. As you advance in the game, the hare will react more quickly. If the hare reaches the flower before the tortoise does so, the game ends. React in lightning speed and defeat the cunning hare!</div>

 <p>Vampire Fe...</p><div id="d">You're Viro, a ninja who stands against evil creatures! Yet you're a complex guy, instead of using conventional weapons, you spread a virus, which only affects demons and undeads.

Vampire Fever is a billiard-like physics game, which you control your character "Viro"(instead of the white ball) and try to infect by touching other creatures on the screen. The virus is very contagious among healthy, but it has one weakness: If two sick creature collide, they both heal.

As you progress, you encounter with different creatures(like vampires, mummies, ghosts, electrocuting demons, chocolate demons, etc...) and artifacts(barrels, bombs, slicers, trees, portals, etc...) which have different properties/physics behaviours, meaning lots of additional fun.

There are three modes included, normal game (with 120 levels), challenge mode(which include 6 levels and different gameplay mechanic) and a level creator.</div>
