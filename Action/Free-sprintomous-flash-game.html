 <p>Bouncing B...</p><div id="d">Our popular Bouncing Balls is addicting enough to make you stay in front of the computer, trying to ascend to the throne of the leaderboard. And now we have made it even more exciting - the multiplayer Bouncing Balls Battle is here! Invite your friends to hold a tournament, or play against a live player online, then experience the endless fun of the extraordinarily indulging game! Same as the solo version, your goal in Bouncing Balls Battle is to shoot and destroy groups of at least 3 balls of the same color. However your key to survive does not solely lies in here - you have to attack your opponent and transmute his pieces into stones, so that he cannot make any moves before he gets in your way. When the game opens, multiple color balls piled up in rows will slowly descend from the top of the play area. A color ball is put into the launcher at the bottom of the area, and the next ball will also be ready. Move your mouse to change the direction of the launcher, then click to shoot a group of 3 or more balls with the same color, so that the whole group of balls can be destroyed. When the balls are removed, the pieces which are only attached to the destroyed group of balls will also be eliminated, for example, when you have destroyed a group of blue balls, the red and yellow balls which are only attached to the blue balls will also be removed. The play area of your opponent will be displayed at the right of your area, allowing you to observe the current game process of your rival. When you drop 5 balls with the destroyed pieces in one go, 3 of your opponent's balls will be turned into stones and can no longer be removed directly. Every 2 pieces additionally dropped on top of the 5 pieces will transform 2 more of your opponent's balls into stones, for example, when 7 of your pieces are dropped with the destroyed balls, then 5 of your rival's pieces will be turned into stones. When you are under attack, you can destroy the junk by dropping them with the balls. If you successfully drop 2 pieces of stones with the balls, 1 of your opponent's pieces will transform, and for every 2 extra pieces of stones successfully removed, 1 more of your rival's pieces will be petrified. The game ends when the pieces of either side have reached the bottom of the play area, therefore it is best to make use of the powerful attack so that your opponent's play area contains nothing but unwanted stones!</div>
