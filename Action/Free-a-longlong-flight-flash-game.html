 <p>Animal Div...</p><div id="d">Join the Animals and seize the gold in 10m Platform Diving! In this game you will play as the penguin representing the Penguin Kingdom to compete in the final of the diving competition. Your opponents include beaver, frog, seal, otter and kingfisher, and your goal is to beat these five contestants and grab the trophy by performing the best jumps in a total of 5 rounds. To ensure fairness, the contestants are only allowed to perform groups 1 to 4 in the tuck(C) position and group 5 in free(D) position. The game begins with the penguin walking to the edge of the platform, and you may choose backward or forward as the jumping direction by clicking on the corresponding icon. If you have selected a direction but would like to change your mind, you may click the other icon to choose the other direction. When you have made the decision, click the Dive button at the bottom, and the penguin will face the selected direction and prepare to jump. A vertical power gauge will show on the right of the penguin, with a red line moving up and down to indicate the power of the jump. To set the power, simply click the mouse or press any key on the keyboard when the red line moves to the desired position. Then another gauge in the shape of a sector will appear on the right side of the power gauge, with a red arrow moving to and from 0 degree to 90 degrees, indicating the angle of the jump. Click the mouse or press any key on the keyboard to select the angle, and upon doing so the penguin will start to jump. The height and distance of the jump are determined by the jumping direction and angle. If the jumping direction and angle are set to the extreme, the penguin will hit the platform and become dizzy, and it will not be able to perform any movements, resulting in an epic fail. Therefore it is best to be careful with the settings of the jumping direction and angle. If the jump is successful, the penguin can perform special tricks in the air before entering the water. You may press the up or down arrow key on the screen or on the keyboard to perform a flip, or hit the left or right arrow key for a twist. Note that once a flipping or twisting direction is chosen, the other arrow key of the same movement will be grayed and cannot be pressed. This is because you may not perform the same movement in both directions during a flight, for example, when you have pressed the down arrow key to perform a forward flip, the up arrow key will turn to gray and you may not perform a backward flip. It is also impossible to perform flip and twist at the same instance, therefore you need to release the arrow keys for flip or twist before performing another trick. When the penguin reaches 5m above the water, a blinking spacebar will show at the upper part of the screen hinting the entry. Press the spacebar on your keyboard so that the penguin will extend its arms forward and prepare for the entry. The flip and twist buttons on the screen will be removed, and another blinking spacebar will appear at the upper part of the screen hinting the suppression of water splash. Press the spacebar on your keyboard again so that the splashing effect can be minimized. The amount of splashes produced is determined by the entry angle. If the dive itself is impossible for human counterparts, a message showing Impossible Dive will appear. After the dive is completed, each of the 5 judges will give a score within the range of 0.0 to 10.0 basing on the flight and the entry. The highest and the lowest scores are then eliminated, while the remaining three are summed and multiplied by the Degree of Difficulty (DD) based on actual diving. The average score of the dive will also be calculated. The penguin will be delighted if the average score is not lower than 7.0, but when it receives an average lower than 7.0 it will be disappointed. The current score and ranking of each contestant will be shown on the leaderboard after each round. When round 5 finishes, the penguin will stand on the podium if its final accumulated score makes a medal, and the national flags will be raised in the victory ceremony. If the penguin is unable to win a medal, the game is over. Showcase your flawless jumps and spectacular movements to become the laureate!</div>
